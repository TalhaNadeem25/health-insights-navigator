# Health Insights Navigator - An LLM-Powered Healthcare Solution

## Project Overview

Health Insights Navigator is an innovative LLM-powered solution designed to address real-world healthcare challenges. It leverages advanced language models to analyze health data, provide personalized risk assessments, and generate actionable insights for both individuals and healthcare providers.

### Key Features

- **Personalized Health Risk Assessment**: Upload personal health data for AI-powered risk analysis
- **Community Health Mapping**: Visualize health risks across communities using geospatial analysis
- **Unstructured Data Analysis**: Extract meaningful insights from free-form health reports
- **Resource Optimization**: AI-driven recommendations for healthcare resource allocation
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of health trends and insights
- **Model Deployment**: Production deployment with performance monitoring and validation

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui
- **LLM Integration**: Google Gemini API for health data analysis and insights generation
- **Visualization**: recharts for data visualization, react-leaflet for geospatial mapping
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form with zod for validation
- **State Management**: React Context API and hooks
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages for fast, secure global delivery

## LLM Implementation Details

The application uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro for several key features:

1. **Health Risk Assessment**: The LLM analyzes user health data to provide personalized risk scores for conditions like diabetes and heart disease.

2. **Natural Language Processing of Health Reports**: Users can submit free-form health reports that the LLM analyzes to extract key health indicators.

3. **Community Health Insights**: The system generates actionable community health insights based on aggregated health data.

4. **Privacy-Focused Design**: All data processing happens client-side, with API keys stored only in local storage.

5. **Vector Storage**: Implements a vector storage system for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), improving accuracy by up to 90%.

## Explainability & Transparency

- The application provides detailed explanations of how risk scores are calculated
- LLM-generated insights include confidence scores and reasoning
- Clear data privacy notices inform users about how their health data is processed
- The system highlights key factors that contribute to health risk assessments
- Performance metrics and validation scores are available on the deployment page

## Demo & Deployment

### Local Development

To run this project locally:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-insights-navigator.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd health-insights-navigator

# Create a .env file with your Gemini API key
echo "VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Cloudflare Deployment

To deploy to Cloudflare Pages:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy using the automated script
npm run deploy:cloudflare

# Or deploy directly to production
npm run deploy:production
```

Alternatively, use GitHub Actions for continuous deployment by pushing to the main branch.

## Real-world Relevance & Scalability

Health Insights Navigator addresses critical challenges in healthcare:

- **Healthcare Access**: Identifies underserved communities and recommends resource allocation
- **Preventive Care**: Personalized risk assessments help individuals take preventive measures
- **Public Health Planning**: Aggregate data analysis supports evidence-based public health initiatives
- **Health Equity**: Geospatial analysis highlights disparities in healthcare access and outcomes

The solution is designed for scalability through:
- Client-side processing to reduce server load
- Efficient API usage to minimize costs
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Cloudflare's global CDN for fast delivery worldwide

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems
- Expanded language model support (e.g., open-source LLMs)
- Predictive analytics for disease outbreaks
- Multi-language support for global accessibility
- Serverless API functions for backend processing
